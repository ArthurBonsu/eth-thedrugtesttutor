Bug-fix beta release here. We're moving to a `beta` › `latest` release pipeline, where all non-hotfix changes are first released in a beta before being promoted to a stable release.

We'd love it if you'd start using the latest betas and let us know early and often if you find any bugs or regressions!

Our beta releases _shouldn't_ introduce any new bugs, but it's very possible we've messed something up. If you'd like the latest-and-greatest Ganache features and fixes, but *possibly* a little less stable, this beta is for you!


## <a name="v2.0.1-beta.0-Highlights"></a>Highlights

Fixes so many issues with the initial 2.0.0 release, you might say this release has been ...  hardenend (that's a chocolate joke) against bugs and is now less ... temperamental (yes, another chocolate joke 🙄) when it comes to crashing 🍫

We've also updated ganache-core, the gooey center powering Ganache UI, to its latest beta. This beta release adds a much-needed gas-estimation fix, as well as many other important bugs fixes!

There's just too many important fixes to summarize them all here, so skip to the [Changelog](#user-content-v2.0.1-beta.0-Changelog) if you want to read up on all the ingredients added to this latest treat!
